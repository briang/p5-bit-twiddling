=head1 SYNOPSIS
    use Bit::Twiddling 'count_set_bits';
    my $number = 0b1111_0001;
    my $set_bits = count_set_bits($number); # 5

    use Bit::Twiddling 'nearest_higher_power_of_2';
    print nearest_higher_power_of_2(   0); # 1
    print nearest_higher_power_of_2(1000); # 1024
    print nearest_higher_power_of_2(1024); # 1024

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library is a collection of bit-manipulation functions written in
C, all taken from the L<Bit Twiddling
Hacks|http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html> webpage.

require XSLoader;
XSLoader::load('Bit::Twiddling', $VERSION);

use Exporter 'import';

=head1 EXPORTS

Nothing is exported by default, but the following functions are
available for export by name

=over 4

count_set_bits

nearest_higher_power_of_2

=back

Additionally, you can request the export of all functions by C<use
Bit::Twiddling ':all'>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

The functions in this module expect a single integer argument, but
will convert string to numeric if needed (and give an C<Argument "..."
isn't numeric in subroutine entry> warning). If the argument is
C<undef>, it will be treated as if it were zero and generate a C<Use
of uninitialized value in subroutine entry> warning.

This distribution was designed to work with a perl compiled with
C<use64bitint> and C<uselongdouble>. It should, however, be OK without
these options.

=head2 count_set_bits

    $bits = count_set_bits($number);

C<count_set_bits> will return the count of how many bits are set (1)
in the binary representation of C<$number>. C<$number> is assumed to
be compatible with C's C<long int> type (probably 64-bits).

=head2 nearest_higher_power_of_2

    $power_of_2 = nearest_higher_power_of_2($number);

C<nearest_higher_power_of_2> will return the largest power-of-two that
is greater-than-or-equal-to C<$number>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

There are two scripts in the C<examples> folder of the dist.

=head2 c.pl

This script contains the original C code that was used with
C<Inline::C> to generate the module's XS.

=head2 benchmarks.pl

Some benchmarks of this module versus various pure Perl
implementations.
